# Idea
## Problem
Unlock a new source of funding for open source projects

## Solution
* Enable fractional ownership of open source projects
* Auction commit level ownership rights to get more liquidity
* An NFT marketplace where each NFT is a code commit
* Simple, fast and frictionless tooling to turn code into NFTs

## Users
* Github repository owners who turn commits to NFTs (and trigger auction)
* Crytpo enthusiasts and collectors who buy/sell these NFTs 

## Milestones
* a webpage to turn code commits into NFTs
* per commit page to buy/sell/auction these NFTs 
* smart contract to make these unique, certified and on-chain
* a Github bot to trigger auction via pull request comments "@TopCommitsBot artify"
* move to Ethereum Mainnet, from ropsten
